# Asobi
Pygame is a great package for Python to create games. Asobi is a wrapper for Pygame to give
Python learners access to the game engine by reducing the amount of Python syntax
and concepts needed to build simple games and/or animations.

At its simplest, a programmer needs only a scalar state variable, such as a number,
a function to update the state variable every tick of the clock, and a functon to render
the image. Asobi takes care of running the UI loop, passing events to the programmer,
and offering a simplified API for displaying shapes and images.
